# Palisade
A partial Sentinel implementation designed to be of value in mock Sentinel
testing as well as custom implementations of Sentinel.

# Status
Early alpha. It works, as in it supports the protocol and can do some basic
stuff. Currently useful if you're writing a mock Sentinel for CI purposes.
